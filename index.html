    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 13, 2025</p>

    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>HTML Dev - HTML Editor & Preview</strong> (referred to as "we", "our", or "the app"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users ("you", "your") about how we handle data when you use our application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Your privacy is our priority. We are committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all users. <strong>HTML Dev</strong> is a fully offline HTML editor and preview tool that does not connect to external servers, and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or non-personal user data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We want to be clear and transparent: this application does <strong>not collect any user data</strong>. Specifically, we do not collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal identification information (e.g., name, email address, phone number)</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No usage analytics</li>
        <li>No device or system information</li>
        <li>No cookies or tracking technologies</li>
        <li>No uploaded content or files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since the app operates entirely offline, all content you create using HTML Dev remains on your device. We do not have access to this data, and we do not store any of it on external servers. You are solely responsible for saving, backing up, or exporting any work created within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Internet Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        HTML Dev does not require or use an internet connection for core functionality. No permissions are requested to access the internet, storage, contacts, camera, or any other sensitive features of your device.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We do not integrate with any third-party analytics platforms, advertising networks, or social media services. No data is shared with any third-party vendors.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This app does not collect any data and does not include any content inappropriate for children. As such, it is fully compliant with privacy laws protecting children under the age of 13 (such as COPPA in the U.S.). Parents can rest assured that their children's privacy is safe while using HTML Dev.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. Since we do not collect user contact information, we recommend checking this page periodically for updates.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Control and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        Because HTML Dev operates completely offline, users have full control over their content. We encourage users to back up their code regularly, as the app does not transmit or store your data elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
